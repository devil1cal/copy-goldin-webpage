  <p>Hi there, I'm self-taught junior front-end designer. This is my second design after the Wise. This is my own code, I will change and fix many issues in time. I'm still learning important componants about the language, espacially CSS. I didn't try to make responsive this one because I need more information about responsive design, but still I need to check, fix and add some componants like;</p>
    <ul>
      <li>I need to change the code for responsive</li>
      <li>I need to add cross-platform componants</li>
      <li>My typography is not working, I need to fix it</li>
      <li>Last page not done yet</li>
     </ul>
   <p>I will be fixed and re-push all my clone & add time stamps</p>
    <p>We will meet again</p>
